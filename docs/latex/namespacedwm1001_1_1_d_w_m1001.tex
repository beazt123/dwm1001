\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Ensure that the com port is an absolute working directory.
The UWB is a state machine. It maintains the last state left by the previous program.
The __init__ standardises the  program to start form the 'ready' state.
Do ensure to stop the data flow manually otherwise the program will only work alternately.

Possible states:
- Reset: When the UWB is plugged in the first time/is manually reset by code or by presing the button
- 'ready': when no data in flowing in but the UWB is online
- Data flowing in - when the UWB is continuously sending in data waiting for a keyboard interrupt
\end{DoxyVerb}
